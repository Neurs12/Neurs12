<sup><i>Upcoming project - Fire Exinguisher (Next.js, Three, Tailwind)</i></sup>

I'm a full-stack developer, 8 years of experience (2016 - 2024), without any work experience, *me love make apps and stuff that help people around me, most of the time*.

Most of my repos on here are documented on how it works and why did I decided to make that. So be sure to check it out!
